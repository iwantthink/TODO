dont ever let somebody tell you , you can't do something 



if you park your car in the wrong place,the trafic policeman will soon find it.

you will be very luck,if he lets you go without a ticket 

However,this does not always happen . Traffic police are sometimes very polite

During a holiday in Sweden,i found this note on my car ."Sir,we welcome you to our city. you are in 'No Parking' area . you will enjoy your stay here,if you pay attention to our street signs.This note is only a reminder"

If you receive a request like this,you cannot fail to obey it



My aunt Jennifer is an actress.

She must be at least thirty-five years old

In spite of this,she often appears on the stage as a young girl

Jennifer will have to take part in a new play soon

This time, she will be a girl of seventeen 

In the play,she must appear in a bright red dress and long black stockings

Last year in another play,she had to wear short socks and a bright oranged-colored dress 

If anyone ever asks her how old she is ,she always answers,'Darling it must be terrible to be grown up'
